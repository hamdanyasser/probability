## 🎯 STUDY STRATEGIES BY TOPIC

### Mastering Combinatorics
1. **Always** start by asking: "Does order matter?"
2. Draw small examples (n=2,3) to verify your formula
3. Use the urn models table as quick reference
4. Practice, practice, practice — these are mechanical

### Mastering Probability
1. For uniform models: Convert to counting
2. Draw pictures: trees for sequential, Venn for unions
3. Always check: Is probability between 0 and 1?
4. Memorize: Complement for "at least one"

### Mastering Conditional Probability
1. Write definition: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
2. LOTP when you can't get $P(A)$ directly
3. Bayes when you need to flip the conditional
4. Independence: verify before multiplying

## 📝 ACTIVE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Worked Example Method
- Read problem
- Cover solution
- Try to solve yourself
- Compare with solution
- If wrong: understand why, then retry from scratch

### Technique 2: Flashcard Spacing
- Day 1: Cards 1-25
- Day 2: Cards 26-50 + review wrong from Day 1
- Day 3: All cards, focus on weak areas

### Technique 3: Problem Generation
- Use PROBLEM_TEMPLATES_30.md
- Generate 5 random problems
- Solve without looking at solutions
- Check answers
- Repeat with 5 more

### Technique 4: Teach-Back
- After studying a section, explain it out loud
- Pretend you're teaching a classmate
- If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet

### Technique 5: Error Log
- Keep a list of every mistake
- Categorize: arithmetic, wrong formula, misread problem, etc.
- Review before exam
- Most errors fall into patterns you can fix

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS (Read Before Exam!)

❌ **Don't assume independence** — verify it!
❌ **Don't confuse disjoint with independent** — they're opposite!
❌ **Don't forget the overlap** in $P(A \cup B)$
❌ **Don't mix up** $P(A|B)$ and $P(B|A)$
❌ **Don't use** $\binom{n+r}{r}$ for stars and bars — it's $\binom{n+r-1}{r}$!
❌ **Don't forget** "without replacement" changes probabilities
❌ **Don't skip** showing your work — partial credit matters!
